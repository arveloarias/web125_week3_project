            <h1>Project WEB125</h1>
            <p>
                I want to use this page as part of a portfolio because it is good enough to demonstrate some knowledge of CSS. I know that is not the more esthetical website, but I really like to build it. This website is created as an assignment for WEB125, which I overdo a little, but the more important is that I got fun making this website. The sensation of coding something, independently of the code language, is one of the more gratifying things that I have done in a long time. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I also created a WordPress website for the class WEB101, which looks really nice. I think <a href="https://olmproject.wordpress.com/"> olmproject.wordpress.com</a>. I used a blank theme for the WordPress website and created my own style, which inspired this website. Even though it wasn't necessary, I added CSS to this page because I had fun doing it. Also, I wanted to add some javascript to add a dark/light mode. I really liked making this website, and maybe the code is not the cleaner because I didn't want to use too much javascript, but I think it looks nice.
