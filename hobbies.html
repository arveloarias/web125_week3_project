            <p>
                I don't know how to start to speak about my hobbies, maybe because I don't have too many hobbies, or at least I can't find time to practice them. But, I love more technology, and more if that technology is related to computers. For me, computers are the more remarkable thing in this world. I remember the first day I got a computer like fourteen years ago, in those times every time was different. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The first time I used a computer, I didn't have access to the internet even though I thought that computers were amazing. After one year or two, I got an internet connection, and then with a CMS to create the website, I learned the basics of HTML. Since the day I learned HTML, I have loved programming and know I'm studying to get a job related to it.
            </p>

            <p> Besides a computer hobby, I also like to read. My favorite books are <i><a href="#books"> one hundred years of solitud</a></i>by Gabriel Garcia Marques and <i><a href="#books">Sherlock Holmes</a></i> books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. There are a lot of books that I love, but those books are my favorite. In the past, I read more, but it is something that I stopped doing lately. I would like to say that is because I don't have time, but we always have time to read at least a little. So I'm going to recover that habit again.
            </p>

            <p>
                Writing is something that I like also. I wrote some stuff in Spanish, but I stopped doing that too. I have a love-hate relationship with writing in English. After all, I learned English because I had to, not because I wanted. But in English101, I found that love for writing in English, and now writing in English is something that Enjoying too, even though I have a lot of misspellings. So, my favorite hobbies are coding, reading, and writing.
